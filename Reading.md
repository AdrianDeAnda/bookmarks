## Quotes

- Antoine de Saint Exupéry, _Wind, Sand and Stars_

> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

- Frank Herbert, _Dune_

> Only suffering leads to enlightenment.

- _Dark Souls_

> Your memory is a monster; you forget—it doesn't. It simply files things away. It keeps things for you, or hides things from you—and summons them to your recall with a will of its own. You think you have a memory, but it has you.

- John Irving, _A Prayer for Owen Meany_

> Just because I don't care, doesn't mean I don't understand.

- Homer Simpson

> Suffer the pain of discipline, or suffer the pain of regret.

- Unknown

> This is Camina Drummer, and this message is for the traitor, the coward Marco Inaros. *You hunted me and mine and still we are here, unbent, unbroken, unbound.* And you? You are nothing. You stole from your own. You abandoned Ceres to the Inners and left Belters to starve. You called yourself a champion and then you ran. So go and raise your bounty. Track me down and kill me if you can. Doesn't matter anymore. I will always be the one who took back what you stole. Camina Drummer did this to you. *Live shamed, and die empty.*

- Camina Drummer, _The Expanse (TV)_
